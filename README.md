- 👋 Hi, I’m @Marco-Buitelaar
- 👀 I’m interested in nothing that concerns you
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to lose friends and alienate people
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on as little as possible
- 📫 How to reach me, PLEASE DON'T!!!
- 😄 Pronouns: I am coming out as binary so my pronouns are 00110101 and 10100110
- ⚡ Fun fact: “Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read.”
